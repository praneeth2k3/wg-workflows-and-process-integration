# T2 Sequential pipeline with handoff

**Primitives used:** [P16 Handoff](../primitives/p16-handoff.md) with a `transfer` return contract at each stage boundary, [P8 TimerDeadline](../primitives/p08-timer-deadline.md) on each handoff, [P15 AuditRecord](../primitives/p15-audit-record.md) per stage.

## Shape

Staged execution where each stage's output contract is the next stage's input contract.

## When to choose it

Choose T2 when the work is genuinely staged — each stage fully consumes the prior stage's output and does not need to revisit it — and when auditability matters more than flexibility. This is the cheapest multi-agent topology to build, reason about, and audit: there is no concurrency, no shared mutable state, and the [handoff contract](../contracts/handoff.md) gives a single well-defined seam per stage. It is comparable to a sequence of BPMN call activities connected by message flow, each stage bounded like a Camunda ad-hoc sub-process (see [OMG BPMN 2.0](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/)).

## When not to

Avoid it when stages need to run concurrently, or when a later stage needs context from more than one stage back.

## Characteristic failure mode

Error and context loss compound across handoffs. Because handoff is lossy by default (see the [handoff contract](../contracts/handoff.md)), a pipeline of `n` stages accumulates up to `n-1` opportunities for silently dropped context, and a failure at stage `k` may be undiagnosable without the discarded context from stage `k-1`.

## Where the deterministic boundary sits

At each handoff seam, where the receiving stage's input contract is validated before the stage begins.
