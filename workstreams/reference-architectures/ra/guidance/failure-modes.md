# Failure modes

The characteristic ways a multi-agent workflow breaks, and the primitive or [global invariant](global-invariants.md) that prevents each one.

| Failure mode | How it manifests | Primitive / invariant that prevents it |
|---|---|---|
| Context loss across handoff | Receiving `AgentStep` lacks information the sender had, producing an output that looks locally correct but is wrong given the full history | [`P16` element 2](../contracts/handoff.md) (declared context transfer) |
| Conflicting concurrent writes to `P17` | Two agents read the same shared state, act independently, and overwrite each other's result without either noticing | `P17`'s declared consistency model; [`P18`](../primitives/p18-arbitration-policy.md) for the conflict itself |
| Unbounded critique loop | Generator-critic loop ([T6](../topologies/t6-generator-critic.md)) never converges because the critic can always find something more to critique | [`P13 Budget`](../primitives/p13-budget.md) cap plus a deterministic stopping rule |
| Recursive spawning | An agent spawns sub-agents that spawn further sub-agents with no bound, exhausting budget and compute | [Global invariant 6](global-invariants.md) (bounded fan-out, static depth limit) |
| Duplicated side effects on handoff retry | A handoff is retried after an ambiguous failure and the receiver's irreversible action executes twice | Retried handoffs MUST be idempotent or compensated via [`P11 Compensation`](../primitives/p11-compensation.md) |
| Privilege creep across handoffs | Each handoff in a chain grants the receiver slightly more than the sender had, "to be safe," until the chain's authority exceeds any single step's original grant | [Global invariant 3](global-invariants.md) (monotonic authority) and [`P16` element 3](../contracts/handoff.md) |
| Deadlock waiting on a peer | A `delegate_and_wait` handoff (T1, T4) never returns because the receiver never completes and no deadline was set | [`P16` element 6](../contracts/handoff.md) (mandatory `P8 TimerDeadline` on every handoff) |
| Diffusion of responsibility | No component is clearly accountable for the final outcome because every `AgentStep` believed another step, or the receiver of its last handoff, owned it | [`P16`](../contracts/handoff.md)'s sharp goal-transfer semantics: the transferring step's obligations end explicitly at handoff, so accountability is always assignable |
| Disagreement with no arbiter | Two agents produce conflicting outputs and the workflow has no rule to resolve the conflict, so it stalls or picks arbitrarily | [`P18 ArbitrationPolicy`](../primitives/p18-arbitration-policy.md), deterministic and mandatory when agents can disagree |
| Audit gaps at organisational boundaries | A cross-org handoff (T4) crosses into a system this workflow's audit log cannot see into, breaking reconstructability | [`P16` element 7](../contracts/handoff.md) (audit continuity / correlation identifier); WG follow-up on A2A alignment |

## On the empirical case for and against multi-agent architectures

Published practitioner and research material has begun cataloguing multi-agent failure modes systematically, and there is a live, credible argument in the field on both sides: that multi-agent decomposition improves breadth-first, genuinely parallelisable work, but degrades on tasks that need one coherent shared context held across the whole task. The multi-agent RA's position (multi-agent as a cost with four legitimate justifications) is argued from first principles in its Purpose section rather than from a specific empirical study, and the sources below are named as directions for the WG to check rather than as confirmed citations.

> **[verify]** The following are named for follow-up verification and are not sourced in this draft: a Berkeley research group's multi-agent failure taxonomy work; Anthropic's published write-up on its own multi-agent research system; and Cognition's public argument against multi-agent architectures for coding-agent-style tasks. None of these has a confirmed URL, title, or specific claim attached in this draft. The WG should locate, read, and cite the primary sources directly before any of the substance above is presented as backed by them.
