# P14 OutcomeContract

**Obligation:** MUST
**Introduced by:** [Single-agent workflow RA](../ra-single-agent.md)

## Definition

A typed result plus an explicit termination classification. Every `AgentStep`, and every multi-agent topology as a whole, MUST resolve to one of seven canonical classifications:

- `completed`
- `completed_with_exceptions`
- `escalated`
- `rejected_by_policy`
- `budget_exhausted`
- `failed`
- `cancelled`

**This file is now the single canonical source for that list.** It was previously stated in the multi-agent RA's interop layer without being enumerated where `P14` itself is defined; that asymmetry is resolved here — every other document that references the seven classifications should point back to this file rather than restate the list.

> **Provenance.** An earlier inconsistency between the two RA files — the multi-agent RA stated this seven-value set explicitly while the single-agent RA, the document that actually defines `P14`, did not enumerate it — has been resolved by consolidating the canonical list in this primitive file rather than in either RA document directly.

### What each classification means

| Classification | Meaning | Correct remediation instinct |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `completed` | The agent reached its goal within budget and policy | None needed |
| `completed_with_exceptions` | The goal was reached, but with deviations worth surfacing | Review the exceptions; do not treat as a clean success |
| `escalated` | Execution was stuck or out-of-policy and was handed to a human or higher authority | Await the escalation decision |
| `rejected_by_policy` | A deterministic gate or human explicitly declined to authorize a proposed action | Never retry automatically without a change in the request or the policy |
| `budget_exhausted` | The agent was making progress but ran out of an externally declared allowance | Very plausibly safe to retry with a larger budget or a narrower goal |
| `failed` | The approach itself broke down — an unrecoverable tool error, a malformed output | Retrying with more budget may just spend more to fail the same way |
| `cancelled` | Execution was terminated deliberately, not by failure or exhaustion | No automated remediation; confirm the cancellation was intended |

## Why it exists

Collapsing distinct failure and non-completion states into a generic `failed` makes automated remediation impossible and the audit trail misleading. Two distinctions carry the weight of this argument.

**`budget_exhausted` versus `failed` require opposite remediation instincts.** A `budget_exhausted` outcome means the agent was making progress toward its goal and ran out of an externally declared allowance before it finished — the correct automated response is very plausibly "retry with a larger budget, or retry with a narrower goal," because nothing about the outcome says the approach was wrong, only that it was not resourced to completion. A `failed` outcome — a tool call that errored out with no recovery path, a malformed output that could not be parsed against the schema — means the approach itself broke down, and retrying with more budget is not obviously going to help; it might just spend more to fail the same way again. An automated remediation system that cannot tell these two apart from the classification alone has no principled basis for deciding whether to retry, and a human reviewing the audit trail later has no principled basis for understanding what actually went wrong without re-reading the full execution history to reconstruct which case it was.

**`rejected_by_policy` versus `failed` is an even sharper case.** `rejected_by_policy` means a deterministic gate looked at what the agent wanted to do and refused — the agent worked correctly and proposed a specific action, and a human or a policy explicitly declined to authorize it. The correct remediation instinct here is "never retry this specific request automatically" — retrying a policy rejection without a change in the request or the policy is not transient-failure recovery, it is repeatedly asking the same question that was already answered no. Collapsing this into `failed` alongside a transient tool error makes an automated retry policy dangerous by default (it might retry a `rejected_by_policy` outcome as if it were a flaky network call) and makes the audit trail actively misleading to a compliance reviewer, who needs to be able to distinguish "the system tried and broke" from "the system asked permission and was refused" without inference.

**No system surveyed makes any of these distinctions natively.** Every reviewed system's terminal-state vocabulary — BPMN end events, execution status fields, workflow completion statuses, graph termination states — has no policy/budget classification at all. Mapping `P14`'s seven values onto the A2A Protocol's task lifecycle states is named as explicit WG follow-up work in the multi-agent RA, not resolved here.

> **[verify]** The exact state names in A2A's task lifecycle, and how each would map onto this RA's seven `P14` classifications, were not confirmed against the [A2A Protocol specification](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/) this session and need direct verification before publication.

### Boundary with the Governance, Risk & Regulatory Alignment WG

This RA emits the `P14` termination classification set, and the policy-gate/`HumanCheckpoint` decision points that feed it, as the control points that WG's regulatory mappings attach to. It does not map those classifications onto specific regulatory obligations, and it leaves undefined which classes of task or tool require a mandatory checkpoint under a given regulatory regime — that threshold is an external input this RA treats as out of scope for itself.

### Why this gap is tractable, and why one part of it isn't

Charter scope item E — workflow portability and interoperability — requires a shared termination vocabulary; without one, "completed" silently means different things in different systems, which defeats portability just as thoroughly as having no vocabulary at all. Closing that half of the gap only requires the WG to agree that `P14`'s seven values are the vocabulary, which this file now does authoritatively. Mapping those seven values onto A2A's task lifecycle states is a different, harder problem: it depends on A2A's own unresolved specifics, not on anything internal to this RA, which is why it is named as WG follow-up work rather than resolved here.

## Prior art

| System | Nearest equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| BPMN 2.0 | Process end events (success/error/terminate) — no policy/budget classification |
| n8n | Execution status — no policy/budget classification |
| AWS Step Functions | Execution status — no policy/budget classification |
| Temporal | Workflow completion status — no policy/budget classification |
| LangGraph | Graph termination state — no policy/budget classification |

Nearest equivalent is editorial judgment, not a conformance claim. Every system surveyed has *some* terminal-state vocabulary, but none makes the policy/budget distinctions `P14` requires — the gap is not the absence of a terminal state, it is the absence of the specific classifications this RA argues are operationally necessary.

## Relationship to other primitives

- [P13 Budget](p13-budget.md) — `budget_exhausted` is the classification a budget-enforced halt produces.
- [P9 ErrorBoundary](p09-error-boundary.md) / [P10 Escalation](p10-escalation.md) — feed `failed` and `escalated` respectively.
- [P16 Handoff](p16-handoff.md) — every multi-agent topology MUST have a deterministic path to a `P14` classification that does not depend on any agent choosing to stop.
- [P19 EvaluationGate](p19-evaluation-gate.md) — a gate that fails at budget exhaustion produces `budget_exhausted`; one that fails on the predicate itself produces `failed` — different classifications, different remediation.
- [P6 HumanCheckpoint](p06-human-checkpoint.md) — a human decision that declines an action produces `rejected_by_policy`.
- [P18 ArbitrationPolicy](p18-arbitration-policy.md) — an arbitrated conflict still resolves to one of the seven classifications, not a separate outcome vocabulary of its own.
- [P11 Compensation](p11-compensation.md) — a compensated effect needs a terminal classification distinct from an uncompensated `failed`.

## Open questions

- Whether `P14`'s termination classifications should align to the A2A Protocol's task lifecycle states; cross-referencing the two is WG follow-up work, not resolved here.
