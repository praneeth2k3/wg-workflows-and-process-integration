# T5 Shared-context / blackboard

**Primitives used:** [P17 SharedContext](../primitives/p17-shared-context.md) with a declared consistency model, [P18 ArbitrationPolicy](../primitives/p18-arbitration-policy.md) for conflicting writes, [P15 AuditRecord](../primitives/p15-audit-record.md) of writes to shared state.

## Shape

Agents coordinate through `P17 SharedContext` rather than through direct handoffs.

## When to choose it

Choose T5 when several agents genuinely need to read and write a common evolving artifact and the work is not naturally sequential — a shared plan, a shared findings document, a shared case file. CMMN's case file is the nearest standards concept for exactly this shape of coordination (see [OMG CMMN](https://www.omg.org/spec/CMMN/)); LangGraph's channels-with-reducers model is the nearest agent-framework concept (see [LangGraph documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)).

## When not to

Avoid it when no consistency model can be agreed and declared.

## Characteristic failure mode

Write conflicts and stale reads. Without a declared consistency model, two agents can read the same state, act on it independently, and write back results that silently overwrite one another — and nothing in the topology will surface that this happened. T5 MUST declare its consistency model (for example: last-writer-wins with a version check, append-only with no overwrite, or single-writer-at-a-time enforced by a lock) before it is used; "eventually consistent" is not a sufficient answer on its own because it says nothing about what an agent should do when it observes a conflict.

## Where the deterministic boundary sits

At the consistency monitor and at `P18`, both of which sit outside any agent's reasoning.
